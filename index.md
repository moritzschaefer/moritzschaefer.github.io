I work on representation learning and generative AI for biomedical data analysis.

After my major in computer science at TU Berlin, I pursued a PhD at ETH Zurich at the intersection of biology and computer science towards a systematic understanding of *regulatory networks in early development*.
At the AI Institute MedUni Vienna and CeMM I focused on the development of *multimodal AI architectures for biomedical data analysis* in the laboratory of Christoph Bock.

Currently, I am working as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford under the supervision of Zinaida Good and Jure Leskovec on *deep learning-driven cell design*.
