I work on representation learning and generative AI for biomedical data analysis.

After my major in computer science at TU Berlin, I pursued a PhD at ETH Zurich at the intersection of biology and computer science towards a systematic understanding of regulatory networks in early development.
My postdoctoral research at the AI Institute of the Medical University of Vienna and the Research Center for Molecular Medicine (CeMM) focuses on the development of multimodal AI architectures for biomedical data analysis in the laboratory of Christoph Bock.
