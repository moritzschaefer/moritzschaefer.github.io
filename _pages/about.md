Hey! 

I am a trained computer scientist (B. Sc./M. Sc.) who discovered the fascinating world of biology (PhD) and is now working on the intersection of the two fields. I worked on gene regulation (PhD 2021 at ETH Zurich) and multimodal modeling of molecular cell measurements. 

Currently, I am working as a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford under the supervision of Zinaida Good and Jure Leskovec on deep learning-driven cell design.
